Web for Everyone Capstone

## Sergio's Site

Sergioâ€™s site is intended to be my first personal website, serving as the capstone project for the final course of the Web Design for Everybody specialization. The following courses were completed as part of the specialization:

* Introduction to HTML5
* Introduction to CSS3
* Interactivity with Javascript
* Advanced Styling and Responsive Design
* **Web Design for Everybody Capstone**

## Requirements

The website has certain requirements that must be met, including:


### Validation
Validation using the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) 

### Responsiveness
Responsiveness for both mobile and desktop views

### Use of CSS3
CSS3 styling *Note:The CSS code for the website is relatively short, as most of the styling is handled by the framework*

### Enhancements

1. Carousel: A carousel has been included in the header section.
2. Nav Recipes: The navigation section has been designed to resemble a recipe card found in a grandma's drawer.
3. Fixed Navbar: The navbar is fixed at the top, requiring adjustments to the body's top padding and some margins.
4. Google Maps iframe: An iframe embedding a Google Maps view has been added.
